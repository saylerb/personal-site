## Hi, I’m Brian


I'm a software developer based in Denver, Colorado. This is a place where I
practice my craft and share what I'm learning about. Thanks for stopping by.

### What I’m into right now
- Currently looking for a new software developer role
- Exploring the mountain west by foot and mountain bike
- Writing about what I'm currently learning about
- Exploring ways to be a better and more consistent writer
